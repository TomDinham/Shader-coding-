# Shader-coding-
My code for 3 specific shaders. Bump map, vector manipulation and transparent, reflective shaders
During my second year at university we asked to produce 3 different shaders using mono develop within unity. For this assignment i created 3 different shaders that could be used in a game. The first one being a waving flag fluttering in the wind. this was created by affecting the normal's of the object. The second was a transparent and reflective shader. With the last being a detailed bitmap shader.
